# An Ultrasonic Navigation System for Blind People
This project is to investigate the development of a navigation aid for blind and visually impaired people. It is based on a *Microcontroller (Arduino UNO)*. This aid is
portable and gives information to the user with the help of different intensity of vibration and ultrasound. The proposed system detects the nearest obstacle via
stereoscopic *Sonar System*.
